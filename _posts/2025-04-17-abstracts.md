Today's the deadline for abstract submission for the next [ISMB](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/home)
conference in Liverpool. We just finished submitting three abstracts
on [Fur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39132289/), barcoding, and ANI computation. After much editing and mutual
reading over the past few days, it's time to relax and keep fingers
crossed.
