Tjorben defended his Master's thesis at Lübeck University today. His
thesis is focused on a web tool he wrote for visualizing the taxonomy
of sequenced life,
[Vitax](https://neighbors.evolbio.mpg.de/vitax/). Genomic regions
present in a given target organism and absent from its closest
taxonomic relatives, its *neighbors*, are the raw material for such
diverse tasks as constructing diagnostic markers and discovering the
genetic basis of species-specific traits. The elegant user interface
of [Vitax](https://neighbors.evolbio.mpg.de/vitax/) makes it easy to
look up any target organism on the tree of life, visualize its
neighbors, and download their genomes.

Like most software, [Vitax](https://neighbors.evolbio.mpg.de/vitax/)
is a work in progress, and Tjorben is staying on in the Bioinformatics
Group to polish it further.
