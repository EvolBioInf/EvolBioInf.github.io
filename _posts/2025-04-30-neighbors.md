The [Neighbors package](https://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors) helps
find genomes for a target organism and its closest relatives, its
*neighbors*. Targets and neighbors can be used to [construct
diagnostic markers](https://github.com/evolbioinf/fur). In the past,
we used the NCBI's [genome
reports](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GENOME_REPORTS/) as our
source of accessions. We have now switched to the NCBI's [assembly
reports](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/),
which are updated daily. Incidentally, this has also tripled the
number of genome accessions indexed by Neighbors.
