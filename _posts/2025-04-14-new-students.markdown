With the start of the summer semester, three Master's students have
joined us to carry out their thesis research: Loyd-Eddie Noll works on
the genomics of smut fungi, Tjorben Nawroth on visualizing taxonomic
trees, and Sara-Lena Welk on resolving incongruencies between taxonomy
and phylogeny. We welcome the three of you!
