The idea of "bit rot" has always seemed a bit fanciful to me. I mean,
organic things like autumn leaves rot. But why should one of the most
ethereal substances I know, software, do something comparable? Then a
colleague of mine recently asked, whether I had an executable for the
program `alfy` we had
[published](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21471011/) back
in 2011. She hoped to used `alfy` to detect recombination among
genomes of the bacterium *Pseudomonas fluorescens* and its
relatives. Sure, I said, typed `make` in the directory of `alfy`'s C
sources, and produced a long list of warnings that ended in an
error. Something was rotten in the state of that software. It took me
a while to remove the rot, but in this
[repo](https://github.com/EvolBioInf/alfy) `alfy` is now back to where
it was in 2011.
