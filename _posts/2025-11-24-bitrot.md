The idea of "but rot" might seem a bit fanciful. After all, perishable
things like autumn leaves rot. But why should a substance as ethereal
as software undergo something similar? We were recently asked by a
colleague for an executable of the program `alfy` we had
[published](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21471011/) back
in 2011. She hoped to used `alfy` to detect recombination among
genomes of the bacterium *Pseudomonas fluorescens* and its
relatives. We thought that should be easy, but running `make` in the
directory of `alfy`'s C sources only produced a long list of warnings
that ended in an error. Clearly something *was* rotten in the state of
that software. It took a while to remove the rot, but in this
[repo](https://github.com/EvolBioInf/alfy) `alfy` is now back to where
it was in 2011.
