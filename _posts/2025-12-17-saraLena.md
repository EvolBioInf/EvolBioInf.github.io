Earlier this week Sara-Lena defended her Master's thesis at Lübeck
University. Sara-Lena compared fast methods for classifying bacteria
based on their genome sequences. She also looked at the extent to
which such genome-based classifications agree with the official
taxonomy at levels below the species. Disagreement is wide-spread, she
found, but on the upside the taxonomy usually still follows the main
phylogenetic signal. Congratulations, Sara-Lena!

After taking a well-deserved break, Sara-Lena will stay with us for a
bit longer to polish the results of her thesis. So you might still see
her around the Institute.
