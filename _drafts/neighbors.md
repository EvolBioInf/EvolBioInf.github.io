The [Neighbors package](https://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors) helps
find genomes for a target organism and its closest relatives, its
*neighbors*. Targets and neighbors can be used to [construct
diagnostic markers](https://github.com/evolbioinf/fur). We have just
updated the source of genome accessions in Neighbors to triple the
number of genomes indexed.
