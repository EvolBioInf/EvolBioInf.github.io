Our software is hosted on the [evolbioinf
repo](https://github.com/evolbioinf), here are four highlights:

+ [`phylonium`](https://github.com/EvolBioInf/phylonium): Fast
distance computation between genome sequences for phylogeny
reconstruction;
[paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/7/2040/5650408?login=true).

+ [`fur`](https://github.com/EvolBioInf/fur): Find unique regions for marker discovery from whole
microbial sequences;
[paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformaticsadvances/article/4/1/vbae113/7721998).

+ [Biobox](https://github.com/EvolBioInf/biobox): Collection of some
50 bioinformatics tools used in
[textbook](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-20414-2)
on sequence analysis on the command line. They cover alignment,
compression, exact matching, plotting of graphs, trees, and networks,
manipulation of FASTA sequences, manipulation of phylogenies, and
statistics.

+ [Neighbors](https://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors): Collection of
  tools for finding samples of target and neighbor genomes from the
  [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy), and for
  sorting them into phylogenetic targets and neighbors.
