## [Beatriz Vieira Mourato](https://beatrizvm.github.io/) and [Bernhard Haubold](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/mitarbeiter/12020)
This is a one-week practical course to learn Go programming with
examples from Bioinformatics. We follow our collection of
approximately 350 solved problems. These cover fundamentals of reading
and writing data, as well sections on writing a simple version of
Blast, and on estimating evolutionary distances from exact matches.

If you like text books, we recommend [*The Go Progrmaming
Language*](https://www.gopl.io/). There is also a lot to be discovered
on the [Go developer site](https://www.gopl.io/), we particularly
recommend the sand box entitle "Try Go" on that page.
