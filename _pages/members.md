![](/images/Bernhard.jpg){: width="150", style="float: left" } | **Prof. Dr. Bernhard Haubold** <br>Group leader<br><br>haubold@evolbio.mpg.de |


I work on fast methods for genome comparison. This involves a fair
amount of programming, which I do in the literate programming idiom,
where a program is addressed primarly to a human reader rather than to
a machine. I also teach at Lübeck University and am a coauthor of two
textbooks on computational biology.

I recently finished my PhD on the applications of [fast methods of
genome comparison to find unique genomic
regions](https://macau.uni-kiel.de/receive/macau_mods_00005514). I
am now exploring how to improve methods for finding samples of targets
and neighbor (closest distinct relatives) genomes.

![](/images/Ivan.jpg){: width="150", style="float: left" } |  **Ivan Tsers** <br>Doctoral researcher<br><br>tsers@evolbio.mpg.de 

I am a doctoral researcher in the group. Currently I'm working on
possible applications of unique genomic regions as taxonomically
informative markers.

![](/images/Lloyd.jpg){: width="150", style="float: left" } |  **Lloyd-Eddie Noll** <br>Master student<br><br>noll@evolbio.mpg.de 

I am a Master's student currently working on my thesis, focusing on
lineage-specific genomic regions of phytopathogenic fungi involved in
the host infection process, as potential candidates for genetic
markers.

<br>

![](/images/Tjorben.jpg){: width="150", style="float: left" } |  **Tjorben Nawroth** <br>Master student<br><br>nawroth@evolbio.mpg.de 

I am a Master's student in Molecular Life Science at the Universität zu Lübeck, currently working on my thesis with the Bioinformatics Research Group at the MPI in Plön. My work focuses on developing an intuitive, web-based application designed to visualize and facilitate the exploration of phylogenetic taxonomies.

I am a Master´s student from the University of Lübeck. I am currently working on my thesis, which focuses on comparing different tools for accessing evolutionary distances in prokaryotes and identifying and resolving the incongruence between taxonomy and phylogeny.
