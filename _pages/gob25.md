## [Beatriz Vieira Mourato](https://beatrizvm.github.io/) and [Bernhard Haubold](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/mitarbeiter/12020)
This is a one-week practical course to learn Go programming with
examples from Bioinformatics. It runs from Monday 10th March
through to Friday 14th, nine to five.

We follow our [collection of solved problems](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/ttOdYUDdIYIZasq).

If you like text books, we recommend [*The Go Progrmaming
Language*](https://www.gopl.io/). There is also a lot to be discovered
at the [Go developer site](https://www.gopl.io/), we particularly
recommend the sand box entitle "Try Go" on that page.
